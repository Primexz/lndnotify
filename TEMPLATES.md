# Template Variables Documentation

This document describes all available template variables that can be used in notification templates for each event type in lndnotify.

      template: "⚡ New Forward: {{.Amount}} sats\nFee earned: {{.Fee}} sats\nRoute: {{.PeerAliasIn}} -> {{.PeerAliasOut}}"
```

Note: All amounts (satoshis) are automatically formatted with proper separators for readability.
