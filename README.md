# ⚡️ LND Notify

A notification system for Lightning Network nodes that monitors and notifies about important events.

This project is heavily inspired by [balanceofsatoshis](https://github.com/alexbosworth/balanceofsatoshis), but with the aim of offering much greater customisation and a wider range of notification destinations.
